				This is the technical standard for web content developers, web authors, web evaluation tool developers and anyone else that needs to adhere to web accessibility. Its goal is to provide a single, shared standard that meets the needs of everyone, everywhere.

			<h3>Level A</h3>
			<p class="fragment">Most minimal level. Typically the easiest to implement from all standpoints (business logic, design and development). More of an impact on all users, not specific to one type of disability.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<span class="section-path">WCAG :: Levels</span>
			<h3>Level AA</h3>
			<p class="fragment">What LMO strives to meet. Requires a little more diligence on everybody, but the benefit impact for all users is greater.</p>	
		</section>
		<section>
			<span class="section-path">WCAG :: Levels</span>
			<h3>Level AAA</h3>
			<p class="fragment">Most difficult to adhere to. In some cases targets more specific disabilities.</p>
		</section>
		<aside class="notes">
			The three levels are how the conformity to the guidelines is to be tested. Using generalities to describe these levels. The full webpage must pass all success criteria tests in order to pass the level. Level AAA is not a generally recommended Level to reach because it's hard for certain types of content, or all content, to adhere to these guidelines. However, there are certain Level AAA items, especially in regards to content markup, that are easy enough to do and should be considered standard practice.

			<h2>Section 508</h2>
			<p class="fragment">Refers to the Federal law that requires all Federal agencies to ensure that any electronic and information technology it develops, procures, maintains or uses is accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>
			<p class="fragment">Refreshed in 2017 to update rules, reorganize standards and harmonize with other guidelines and standards such as the European Commission and WCAG. Compliance to begin in January 2018.</p>
			<aside class="notes">
				Wading through accessibility documentation is a painstaking task. So far there isn't a revised 508 checklist to follow. For any Federal websites LMO made produce, we'll follow the Section 508 rules as we know them today. However, with Section 508 now also adhering to WCAG 2.0 Level AA, so long as we follow those guidelines - and pass them - the websites we produce will also most likely be 508 compliant as well.

			<h3>Lawsuits</h3>
			<p>Finance/Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, E-Commerce, Government and Education websites have a higher probability of incurring a lawsuit. However, retailers are a common target of lawsuits.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="fragment">2008 Target Corporation Settles with NFB paying 6 million in damages</li>
				<li class="fragment">2015 over 60 website accessibility lawsuits</li>
				<li class="fragment">2016 over 240 website accessiblity lawsuits</li>
				<li class="fragment">2016 LMO produces accessiblity audit and website updates for client Stein Sperling</li>
				<li class="fragment">2017 UC Berkley pulls 20,000 videos rather than making them accessible</li>
			</ul>
			<aside class="notes">
				Lawsuits are filed under ADA Title II and III. Title II pertains to public universities. Title III specifically cites that accessibility descrimination cannot take place in 'public accommodation.' The law does not specifically include websites as the law was made in the infancy of the web and has yet to be changed. It is up to individual courts to determine how they want to interpret the law. So there have been the large uptick in lawsuits because the DOJ is cracking down, lawyers are benefiting from those cases that are winning, and because the laws haven't been updated. The ADA laws are likely to be updated in the upcoming years, and with that we'll most likely see more of an emphasis on inclusive websites. LMO is slightly ahead of the curve as we try to concentrate on a lot of accessibility best practices. However, it would behoove us as a company to be in the habit of looking at ux, design and development with accessibility in mind. This shouldn't be an upsell. This should be a part of our best practice. And so with the rest of this presentation, I'll outline how those that produce websites (ux, design, dev) will benefit all users by following WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines.

				Stein Sperling - Law firm that had a client that was being sued for accessibilty violations. That in turn made the lawfirm be more cognizant of the accessbility problems with their website and they wanted to proactive. They contacted LMO to make their website more accessible. First an audit was done use a few tool resources as well as manual checks to compile a list of issues on a per template basis. The audit was provided to Stein Sperling and they chose to proceed with the necessary fixes.
