                    The three levels are how the conformity to the guidelines is to be tested. Using generalities to describe these levels. The full webpage must pass all success criteria tests in order to pass the level. Level AAA is not a generally recommended Level to
                    reach because it's hard for certain types of content, or all content, to adhere to these guidelines. However, there are certain Level AAA items, especially in regards to content markup, that are easy enough to do and should be considered
                    standard practice.

                        Wading through accessibility documentation is a painstaking task. So far there isn't a revised 508 checklist to follow. For any Federal websites LMO made produce, we'll follow the Section 508 rules as we know them today. However, with Section 508 now
                        also adhering to WCAG 2.0 Level AA, so long as we follow those guidelines - and pass them - the websites we produce will also most likely be 508 compliant as well.

                        Many websites filed by the same lawfirm to try to make a buck on settlement. Lawsuits are filed under ADA Title II and III. Title II pertains to public universities. Title III specifically cites that accessibility descrimination cannot take place in 'public
                        accommodation.' The law does not specifically include websites as the law was made in the infancy of the web and has yet to be changed. It is up to individual courts to determine how they want to interpret the law. So there have
                        been the large uptick in lawsuits because the DOJ is cracking down, lawyers are benefiting from those cases that are winning, and because the laws haven't been updated. The ADA laws are likely to be updated in the upcoming years,
                        and with that we'll most likely see more of an emphasis on inclusive websites. LMO is slightly ahead of the curve as we try to concentrate on a lot of accessibility best practices. However, it would behoove us as a company to be
                        in the habit of looking at ux, design and development with accessibility in mind. This shouldn't be an upsell. This should be a part of our best practice. And so with the rest of this presentation, I'll outline how those that produce
                        websites (ux, design, dev) will benefit all users by following WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines.

                        Thousands of letters sent each year to business outining accessibility issues and asking for recourse. Universities and School Systems County, City sites Stein Sperling - Law firm that had a client that was being sued for accessibilty violations. That
                        in turn made the lawfirm be more cognizant of the accessbility problems with their website and they wanted to proactive. They contacted LMO to make their website more accessible. First an audit was done use a few tool resources
                        as well as manual checks to compile a list of issues on a per template basis. The audit was provided to Stein Sperling and they chose to proceed with the necessary fixes.

                        this content right away? If there's a definite need for it to be hidden initially, there should be a button prompt letting the user know that they have to take an action to view the rest of the content. lose ability to scan a page

                        if any, need to be made for larger screens. When I say scannable, I mean are the structural components (header, footer, sidebar) easily differentiated from the main content? And is the main content laid out with a page title followed
                        by corresponding page content with quickly readable headers that give meaning to the content on the page? The last point is kind of self explantory.

                        confusion, it can also have a dramatic impact on overall page weight. Font variants should be used only as necessary. Using all caps in large blocks of text makes reading difficulty - limit the use of all caps. Blinking and moving
                        text can cause distractions. There's also a WCAG guideline that requires any autoplaying animations/video must require pause/stop functionality.</aside>
