			<h2>Wireframe and Design Reviews are Important</h2>
			<aside class="notes">I have this under FE Dev, but really it's important for everyone to be invloved in the review process from each department. We should all be checking over the work that will be shown to the client to ensure it's meeting a11y and all other business goals and objectives.</aside>

			<h2>(re)test color contrast</h2>
			<aside class="notes">The goal moving forward to is have the design team check all their color choices against the contrast ratios, but it's we all know that things change during development. The front-end team should be running a re-check of any colors that seem questionable.</aside>

			<h2>A11Y Quick Points</h2>
			<ul>
				<li class="fragment">Content reads logically if CSS is turned off</li>
				<li class="fragment">Semantic markup and landmark roles</li>
				<li class="fragment">Skip link</li>
				<li class="fragment">All buttons have text</li>
				<li class="fragment">Page title</li>
				<li class="fragment">Focus states</li>
				<li class="fragment">Keyboard accessible</li>
				<li class="fragment">Image Alt tags</li>
				<li class="fragment">Legible at 200%</li>
				<li class="fragment">Forms</li>
				<li class="fragment">Validation</li>
			</ul>
			<aside class="notes">Semantic markup is probably one of the most important a11y needs as well as one of the easiest to implement or fix. Landmark role of main with an ID for the skip link. Page title as well as all other meta tags (not a11y required) but need to make sure we're including OG tags and Twitter card tags in addition to page title and description meta information. Button markup needs text inside of it. All sections of the site must be keyboard accessible and should show appropriate focus states.</aside>
